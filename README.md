# Affy's Calculator using flexbox

Affy designed a calculator for me using Figma and I'd love to recreate it with Flexbox and or Grids using CSS.

I'll be back to make it functional.

Git push worked after I'd used git push -u origin master at first

I have finalized my project.
Flex-direction: column; means it will stack on top of each other.
Gap or row gap etc don't work on flexbox.
I used Flexbox and Grid for this project.

Ended this project 27th May, 2022.
